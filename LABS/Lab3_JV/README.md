These are simple copy pastes from my notebook.

## Questions to answer:

- ### a) What is the relationship between between gender and whether a person makes more than $50k?

I calculated the ratios for each gender group to hopefully account for the fact that there are way more men in this sample than females.  The ratios show that men are more likely to make more than \$50K.  This is further shown in the bar graph from the next cell.  So overall, men tend to make more than \$50K in comparison to women.

- ### b) When a person makes more than $50, what is the relationship between gender and occupation? What about for less?

Based on the previous question, it is already known that men dominate both the sample population and upper class vacancy.  The graphs back up the statistics from the above graph, and show that not only do men tend to pick higher paying jobs, but women also tend to pick lower paying jobs.  This does make sense, especially since most mothers would rather have a lighter job in order to take care of the children while the husband (if applicable) typically provides the primary income.  This is not true for all men and women, but it is true for MOST based on this specific data sample.

- ### c) When are the “richest” professions in each possible native country?

This is hard to measure due to the fact that the only information given in terms of a professions salary is binary: greater than or less than/equal to \$50K.  

- ### d) What is the relationship between race and level of education? Does it further seem to relate to whether a person makes more than $50k?

The mean and median years of education held by race are fairly close, and for all races they rank the same positions in both of these statistics.  It seems that asians and whites hold the longest time in school, but only by 1 year on average.  These next findings are slightly inaccurate due to the small sample size, but whites and asian/pacific islanders are most likely to be in the upper class.  This hints towards a trend but again, the sample size for most minorities on the list is very small.
